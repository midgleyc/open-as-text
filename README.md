Open as Text
============

Open as Text is a Firefox WebExtension that adds a context menu item for opening links as text/plain. It serves as a replacement for the one feature of [Open in Browser](https://github.com/spasche/openinbrowser) that I use frequently.

## Installation

You can install the extension from its [addons.mozilla.org page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/open-as-text/).
